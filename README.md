# CSS Responsive Design 

In this course, I gained a strong understanding of how to build responsive websites using CSS. I learned key concepts such as:

- Media Queries: Creating layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
- Flexbox and Grid: Designing flexible and grid-based layouts for efficient responsiveness.
- Responsive Typography and Images: Ensuring text and visuals scale seamlessly across various devices.
- Mobile-First Design: Developing designs optimized for mobile users and scaling up for larger screens.
- Best Practices: Writing clean and maintainable CSS code for responsive web development.
- Breakpoints and Mobile-First Design: Structuring designs to prioritize smaller screens before scaling up.
- Viewport and Units: Using relative units like %, em, rem, and vw/vh for responsive scaling.

By the end of the course, I successfully created web pages that are user-friendly, visually appealing, and functional across a wide range of devices. This course has prepared me to build modern, responsive websites tailored to diverse audiences.
